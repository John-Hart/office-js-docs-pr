# Explore Office JavaScript API using Script Lab

So you're interested in developing Office Add-ins. There are several ways to explore the Office JavaScript API (for example, quick starts and tutorials) but the [Script Lab](https://store.office.com/app.aspx?assetid=WA104380862) add-in, available free from the Office store, enables you to do so without your creating an add-in yet. Script Lab is also a great way to prototype and verify functionality you want to include in your add-in.

## What is Script Lab?

Script Lab is a tool for anyone who wants to learn about developing Office Add-ins for Excel, Word, PowerPoint, and Project using Office JS API. It provides IntelliSense so you can see what's available. You can use existing samples in an Office host application to quickly try out something or use a sample as the base for your own. Another cool thing is that, through Script Lab, you might be able to try beta or preview functionality like [custom functions](/office/dev/add-ins/excel/custom-functions-overview).

> [!TIP]
> In order to participate in beta or preview, you may have to sign up for the [Office Insider program](https://products.office.com/office-insider).
